the expert on your own needs and workflows.\n-   This workshop will help you:\n    -   Build a system for **your specific goals**.\n    -   Avoid the overwhelm I experienced.\n\n\n-   A practical starting kit to take home.\n-   An understanding of key concepts and tools.\n-   Confidence to explore and adapt PKM further on your own.\n\n## What is PKM? {.tea-theme}\n\n-   **Definition**:\n    -   A system for **capturing**, **organizing**, and **retrieving** knowledge efficiently.\n-   **Why PKM Matters**:\n    -   Challenges: Information overload, scattered notes, difficult retrieval.\n    -   Benefits: Boost research efficiency, streamline writing, improve focus.\n\n## How PKM Fits Your Research Needs {.tea-theme}\n\n-   **Capture Knowledge**:\n    -   Gather notes, ideas, and information.\n-   **Organize Effectively**:\n    -   Group related items by projects, tasks, or themes.\n-   **Retrieve Quickly**:\n    -   Find what you need when you need it.\n-   **Collaborate Better**:\n    -   Share ideas and build connections.\n-   **Move Projects Forward**:\n    -   Turn scattered information into tangible outcomes.\n\n## Poll Results {.tea-theme}\n\n-   **Question**: \"What do you need Personal Knowledge Management for?\"\n-   **Responses**:\n    -   **Everything**\n\n## Current Workflows and Challenges {.tea-theme}\n\n-   **Reflect on Your Practices**:\n    -   Tools you use (analog or digital).\n    -   How you organize notes (folders, tags).\n-   **Challenges**:\n    -   Losing track of papers or ideas.\n    -   Overwhelming, unstructured notes.\n-   **Discussion**:\n    -   Share your workflows and struggles.\n\n## Common Pitfalls in PKM {.rose-theme}\n\n-   **Challenges**:\n    -   Overcomplication: Too many tools or frameworks.\n    -   Inconsistency: Poor tagging or organization habits.\n    -   Fear of starting: Blank page syndrome.\n-   **Solutions**:\n    -   Start small.\n    -   Build workflows iteratively.\n    -   Focus on consistency.\n\n## Tools for PKM: Logseq and Obsidian {.rose-theme}\n\n-   **What are they?**\n    -   Tools designed to help you organize, connect, and retrieve knowledge.\n    -   Focused on personal workflows and flexibility.\n\n## Why I Chose These Two {.rose-theme .incremental}\n\n::::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n**Logseq**\\\n- Open-source.\\\n- Great for journaling and task management.\\\n- Helps build structured, hierarchical notes.\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n**Obsidian**\\\n- Free with optional paid extras.\\\n- Great for visualizing connections (Graph View).\\\n- Flexible with many plugins.\n:::\n:::::\n\n## Why Not Other Apps? {.rose-theme}\n\n-   **Notion**:\n    -   Cloud-based:\n        -   Requires internet for most features.\n        -   Less privacy (your data is stored on their servers).\n    -   No true offline access.\n-   **Paid Apps**:\n    -   Many apps (like Roam Research) require monthly subscriptions.\n-   **These Two Work Well for Free**:\n    -   Both Logseq and Obsidian store notes locally and work offline.\n\n## Limitations of Logseq and Obsidian\n\n-   **Logseq**:\n    -   Still in beta:\n        -   Occasional bugs and incomplete features.\n    -   Limited plugin availability:\n        -   Fewer plugins compared to Obsidian.\n-   **Obsidian**:\n    -   Plugin dependency:\n        -   Many advanced features rely on community plugins.\n    -   Less emphasis on journaling:\n        -   Focuses more on linking and long-form writing.\n\n## Designing Your Workflow\n\n-   **How to Start**:\n    -   Identify key goals.\n    -   Focus on 1-2 knowledge categories (e.g., literature, daily tasks).\n-   **Build Iteratively**:\n    -   Customize templates, tags, and metadata.\n    -   Experiment and refine your system.\n\n### Zettelkasten\n\n::::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n-   **What it is**:\n    -   A German term meaning \"slip-box.\"\n    -   Focuses on creating small, self-contained notes
