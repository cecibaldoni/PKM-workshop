Welcome to the **Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) Workshop** repository! <br>
This repository was created for the workshop "Personal Knowledge Management and Note-Taking Apps", designed for the [IMPRS QBEE](https://imprs-qbee.mpg.de/) Doctoral students. <br>
The workshop focuses on Logseq and Obsidian, and general note-taking strategies.
