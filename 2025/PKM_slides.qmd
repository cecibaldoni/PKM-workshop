## Welcome to the PKM Workshop

- Learn how to organize knowledge effectively
- Explore tools: [Logseq](https://logseq.com/) and [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)
- Build systems that work **for you**

## Today's Goal

Build a personal knowledge management system that makes information **easy to find** when you need it.
